# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Model
Machine Learning Classification Model based on Random Forest Algorithm using Breast Cancer Dataset.

**Objective:**

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world.Breast cancer caused 685,000 deaths globally in 2020. Roughly half of all breast cancers occur in women with no specific risk factors other than sex and age. It occurs in every country in the world.
Approximately 0.5â€“1% of breast cancers occur in men.

One of the major tasks on this dataset is to predict based on the given attributes of a patient whether that particular person has Benign or Malignant cancer, other is the experimental task to diagnose and find out various insights from this dataset which could help in understanding the problem more.

**About Dataset:**

This is a multivariate type of dataset which means providing or involving a variety of separate mathematical or statistical variables, multivariate numerical data analysis. There are total 569 rows and 32 columns.


**Algorithm: Random Forest**

Random Forest is one of the most powerful and effective machine learning technique in which the data is split between multiple decision trees and final decisions are made based on majority count of output in case of classification and mean in case of regression.

**Language and library:**

Language: Python 3.11.4

Library: sklearn
